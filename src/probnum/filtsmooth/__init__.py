"""Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing.

This package provides different kinds of Bayesian filters and smoothers
which estimate the distribution over observed and hidden variables in a
sequential model. The two operations differ by what information they
use. Filtering considers all observations up to a given point, while
smoothing takes the entire set of observations into account.
